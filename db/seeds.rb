# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# DayOfWeek.create(name: "日曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "月曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "火曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "水曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "木曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "金曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "土曜")
# DayOfWeek.create(name: "未定")
